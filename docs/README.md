Dojo is ***homemade*** machine learning library. All the algorithms are implemented from scratch with NumPy and SciPy.
Therefor, they may not be the most optimized/fast piece of code. The library's purpose is studying. I created this library in order to understand the inner workings of the machine learning algorithms - algorithms that have a reputation to be used as a ***black box*** by many engineers. Implementing this library helped me grasp the concept of machine learning and AI overall. I believe that the only way to really understand something is by building it from scratch.
